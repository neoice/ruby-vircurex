ruby-vircurex is just a simple wrapper around the vircurex API as described here: https://vircurex.com/welcome/api

example:
  require 'vircurex'
  
  api = Vircurex::API.new("mikhail")
  response = api.get_balance({:currency => "btc"}, "soopersecretword")
  # do whatever with response
  puts response.inspect
